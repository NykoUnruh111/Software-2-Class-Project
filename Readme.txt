Directions for running this program: Once you have opened up the program you will be presented with a login screen.  Please enter the username "test" and password "test".  Once you are logged in you will be connected to the database and all current users and appointments will populate on the main screen.  From the main screen you can add, edit, and remove customer entries as well as appointments.  When you click add or edit a new window will pop up with the required prompts to complete your action (e.g. adding/modifying a customer).  To delete a customer you must also delete all associated appointments, failure to do so will result in an error when attempting to delete a customer.

In the third report we look at the total number of customers, total number of employees, and the average employee per customer.  This type of report could be useful when attempting to
determine if you have enough employees to take care of your current customer base.
